# openLCA web UI - Proof of concept

## Description

This project aims at testing and showing that the new features of React Router are worth investigating and implementing.

 - `createBrowserRouter` to simply organize the `Route`,
 - `errorElement` together with `useRouteError` to render a error component if needed,
 - `loader` to provide data to the route element before it renders (see `systems-page`),
 - `defer` in `loader` function together with `Await`/`Suspense` (see `system-page`, `results-page`),
 - `Form` from React Router, a quick simple way to make a form without handler and submit function (must have!). This form simply do a fetch with its entries (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/results/2?method=agribalyse&regio=on`). Advantage:
    - user can share the link with the parameters,
    - URLs are stored in history, easy to come back to it (previous/next page),
    - users can refresh the page with the same UI,
    - users can directly edit the URL,
    - users can easily save the URLs.
  
## Features
- layout with a header and a footer as every React app,
- `/system`: list of product systems. When clicking on an item, it fakely fetches the data with a duration proportional to the indices. NÂ°4 is nower to be found on the server.
- `/system/:uuid` the corresponding product systems. The choice of the method allow to play with different scenarios.
- `results` the results page for the corresponding product systems and calculation setup.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run with [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

### `bun dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `bun run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
